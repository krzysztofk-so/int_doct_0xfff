I would recommend this structure for a Terraform repository to use modules so that we do not need to repeat ourselves and define EC2 definitions.

Basically, I would divide it into dev, test, and prod environments. Since we would like to use different cloud providers, I would separately define the resources needed for each provider, such as EC2 for AWS and Compute for Google. In my opinion, this approach will keep everything segmented, and we will be able to navigate to each directory and execute terraform apply.

I did not specify much for GCP, but I would follow the same approach.

For example:
task2-terraform/ -> environments/ -> prod/ -> ec2

Then run terraform init && terraform apply.


task2-terraform/
|-> environments/
    |
    |-> dev/ec2
      |-> main.tf #main code
      |-> variables.tf #variable definitation
      |-> outputs.tf #output data from main.tf
      |-> terraform.tfvars # values for variables
    |-> dev/gcp
    |-> test/ec2
      |-> main.tf #main code
      |-> variables.tf #variable definitation
      |-> outputs.tf #output data from main.tf
      |-> terraform.tfvars # values for variables
    |-> test/gcp
      |->

    |-> prod/ec2
      |-> main.tf #main code
      |-> variables.tf #variable definitation
      |-> outputs.tf #output data from main.tf
      |-> provider.tf # provider definitation
      |-> terraform.tfvars # values for variables
    |-> prod/gcp
      |->

    | -> /services

        	|-> ec2/
    	|->gcp
       		|-> compute/
